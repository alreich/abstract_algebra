    "To understand what is meant by *Abstract Algebra*, consider the \"concrete\" version of algebra that most of us were taught in school.  It involved the arithmetic operations of addition ($+$), subtraction ($-$), multiplication ($\\times$), and division ($\\div$), along with the use of letters of the alphabet ($a,b,x,y,...$) as placeholders for numbers, such as whole numbers, fractions, and decimal numbers -- what mathematicians refer to as integers (denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}$), rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$), and real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our teachers presented us with various *expressions* (\"formulas\" and equations) and asked us to perform tasks with them, such as \"plugging in values\" (replacing letters with actual numbers) or solving equations for one of the letters, a so-called *unknown quantity* or *variable*, usually denoted by $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we were taught four operation of arithmetic, $+$, $-$, $\\times$, and $\\div$, they can be thought of as just two opersions, addition and multiplication.  Subtraction is addition using negative numbers, $5 - 2 = 5 + (-2)$, and division is multiplication using reciprocals, $5 \\div 2 = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.  Here, we've used a something called *inverses*.  The additive inverse of 2 is -2, and the multiplicative inverse of 2 is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a geometric perspective to numbers by thinking of positive numbers as measuring length. Addition combines lengths into a total length, and multiplication combines lengths into a measure of area.  If we generalize to volumes, do we need a third operation?  No, the two operations of addition and multiplication suffice."
