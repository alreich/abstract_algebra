It can be more abstract, and sometimes not; it depends on which group is being discussed. For this reason, other symbols might be used to describe a group's binary operation, often $+$, $\\times$, and $\\cdot$.  Very often, no symbol at all is used, e.g., $ab$ instead of $a \\circ b$. That will be the case here\n"
