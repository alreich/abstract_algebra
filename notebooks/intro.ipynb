    "The symbol, $\\otimes$, is used here to emphasize that it is not the same as numeric addition, $+$, or multiplication, $\\times$.  It can be more abstract...and sometimes not; it depends on which group is being discussed. For this reason, other symbols might be used to describe a group's binary operation, even $+$ and $\\times$.  Very often, no symbol at all is used, e.g., $ab$ instead of $a \\otimes b$.  And, since groups are associative, there is no ambiquity in writing, $abc$ to denote $a \\otimes b \\otimes c$.\n",
